Week 2: BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling
Objective

Build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

Understanding System-on-Chip (SoC)

A System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates all major components of a computer or embedded system onto a single chip. Typical components include:

CPU (Central Processing Unit): Executes instructions and performs computations.

Memory: Stores data and instructions (RAM, ROM, cache).

Peripherals: Interfaces such as GPIO, UART, timers, ADCs for interacting with external devices.

Interconnect / Bus: Communication pathways connecting CPU, memory, and peripherals.

SoCs are widely used in electronics like smartphones, IoT devices, and automotive systems due to their compact size, low power, and high performance.

The Role of BabySoC

BabySoC is a simplified model of a full SoC designed for learning purposes. It allows us to:

Understand core SoC components and interactions without complex industrial design details.

Practice functional modelling to simulate system behavior before RTL implementation.

Experiment with CPU-memory-peripheral interactions in a manageable environment.

BabySoC provides hands-on insight into instruction execution, data flow, and peripheral communication.

Importance of Functional Modelling

Functional modelling helps designers:

Validate system behavior early, catching errors before RTL coding and synthesis.

Test architectural ideas quickly using simulation tools like Icarus Verilog.

Visualize timing, signal interactions, and data flow through GTKWave.

It bridges conceptual understanding and practical RTL implementation, ensuring correct SoC function before synthesis and tapeout.

Conclusion

This week, BabySoC helped establish a strong foundation in SoC design. By studying components, interconnects, and functional modelling, we are better prepared for RTL design and tapeout tasks. BabySoC is an accessible entry point for structured learning and simulation practice.
