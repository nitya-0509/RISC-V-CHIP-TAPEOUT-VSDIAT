Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning


1. Chip Modelling (O1)
* The design process begins with specifications written in C model.

* A testbench in C language is used for functional verification at the specification level.

* This ensures early validation of the intended functionality before moving to hardware design.

________________


2. RTL Architecture (O2)
   * Hardware is described in RTL (Verilog), which acts as the soft copy of the design.

   * Major RTL components include:

      * Processor Core

      * Peripherals and IP blocks

         * This stage bridges the high-level specification with implementable hardware.

________________


3. Synthesis and SoC Integration (O3)
            * RTL synthesis generates the Gate-Level Netlist.

            * Integration involves:

               * Synthesized processor logic

               * Synthesized macros (hard/soft logic)

               * Analog IPs (functional RTL models)

                  * SoC integration ensures all blocks (including GPIOs) are correctly connected.

                  * Physical design steps (floorplanning, placement, routing, CTS) are performed.

                  * Final design undergoes DRC/LVS checks, producing the GDSII file used for tapeout.

4. Fabricated Chip Deployment (O4)
                     * The fabricated chip operates at 100–130 MHz and interacts with peripherals.

                     * Consistency across all design stages is ensured (O1 = O2 = O3 = O4).

                     * The verified chip is deployed in real-world applications such as:

                        * iWatch

                        * Arduino Boards

                        * TV Panels

                        * AC Applications

Conclusion
The RISC-V SoC design flow moves seamlessly from C model specification → RTL design → Synthesis and SoC integration → Final Tapeout and Deployment.
This structured process ensures functional correctness at every stage and results in reliable chips for consumer and industrial applications.
